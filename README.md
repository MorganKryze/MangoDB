## Project structure

The project is divided into the following sections:

- `Diagrams`: Contains the UML and ERD diagrams for the database structure.
- `src/database`: Contains the SQL scripts to create the database and the docker-compose file.
- `src/MangoDB`: Contains the C# console application project.

## Getting started

### Clone the repository

To work with the project, you need to clone the repository on your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MorganKryze/MangoDB.git
```

or download the zip file.

### Build the diagrams

For the diagrams, we use [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/). You can use the [PlantUML extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) for Visual Studio Code to visualize the diagrams, or you can use the [PlantUML online editor](https://plantuml.com/).

Then you can export the diagrams to images (png for distribution and svg for comfort).

The other one is a draw.io file, you can open it with [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) exported to pdf.

### Build the database

To build the database, you need to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed on your machine.

Start by duplicating the `src/database/.env.example` file and renaming it to `.env`.

Then, put yourself in the `src/database` directory.

```bash
cd src/database
```

Finally, you can run the following command to build the database.

```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Build the C# console application

To build the C# console application, you need to have [.NET 8](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed on your machine.

Put yourself in the `src/MangoDB` directory.

```bash
cd src/MangoDB
```

Then, you can run the following command to build the project.

```bash
dotnet run
```
